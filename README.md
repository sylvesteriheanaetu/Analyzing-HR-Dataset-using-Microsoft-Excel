### 📚 Project Overview
This data analysis project aims at providing insights into the performance of a company over the past years. By analyzing various aspects of the dataset, we seek to identify key metrics, trends, and proving insights into employee satisfaction, retention, work-life balance, gender diversity and gain a deeper understanding of the company's HR Department performance.

### 📊 Data Analysis

Data Analytical Expressions (DAX) calculations/measures were adopted in the determination of some key metrics used in the analytical processes. In order to enalbe the use of models, the check box (as illustrated in the image below) must be ticked while inserting the pivot table(s).

|KEY METRICS|DAX CALCULATIONS|
|-----------|---------------|
|Total Employee|=COUNT(Employee[ID employe])|
|Headcount|=CALCULATE([Total Employee], Employee[Attrition]="No")|
|Employee[Attrition]="No")|=CALCULATE([Total Employee],Employee[Attrition]="Yes")|
|Termination Rate|=[Termination]/ [Headcount]|
|Salary|=CALCULATE(SUM(Employee[Salary]),Employee[Attrition]="No")|
